title: "Version control. Git."
summary: A bibliography is a systematic list of sources consulted during research, crucial for academic credibility and avoiding plagiarism. It differs from "References" by including all sources, not just those directly cited. Key elements include author, title, publication details, and DOI/URL. Common citation styles like MLA, APA, and Chicago each have specific formatting rules. Creating a bibliography involves gathering source information, choosing a style, formatting entries, alphabetizing, and proofreading. Tools like Zotero and Mendeley streamline the process, but careful attention to detail is essential to avoid common mistakes and maintain academic integrity.

## What is a Bibliography?

Version control (also known as source control) is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.  Think of it like a sophisticated "undo" button, but for entire projects, not just single actions. It's crucial for software development and any collaborative project where you need to track changes, revert to previous states, and manage contributions from multiple people.

•  Definition: A bibliography is a systematic list of all the sources (books, articles, websites, etc.) that you consulted and potentially used in your research, whether or not you directly cited them in your work. It's an alphabetical compilation of source information that allows readers to locate and verify the sources you used to support your claims. It demonstrates the breadth and depth of your research and gives credit to the original authors whose work influenced your own.

## Distinction from References/Works Cited

•  Bibliography: Includes all sources consulted during your research, even if they weren't directly quoted or paraphrased in your text. It provides a broader overview of the relevant literature.
  •  References/Works Cited: Includes only the sources that you explicitly cited (quoted, paraphrased, or summarized) in your paper. This is a more focused list directly connected to the specific information presented in your work.

## Purpose

•  Credibility & Transparency: Shows that your research is based on reliable and valid sources.
  •  Attribution: Gives credit to the original authors for their ideas and work. Prevents plagiarism.
  •  Context: Provides readers with the necessary information to locate the sources you used.
  •  Building on Existing Knowledge: Demonstrates your understanding of the existing body of literature in your field.
  •  Facilitating Further Research: Allows readers to explore related topics and delve deeper into the subject matter.

## Key Elements of a Bibliographic Entry:

The exact information included in a bibliographic entry depends on the type of source and the citation style being used, but common elements include:

•  Author(s): The person or people responsible for creating the work. Order of authors is important and generally follows the order listed on the source.
•  Title of Work: The full title of the book, article, website, etc. Capitalization and italics/quotation marks vary by style.
•  Title of Source (if applicable): For example, the title of the journal or book in which an article is published.
•  Publication Date: The year (and sometimes month/day) the work was published.
•  Publisher: The company or organization that published the work (primarily for books).
•  Place of Publication: The city where the publisher is located (primarily for books).
•  Volume/Issue Number: For journals and periodicals.
•  Page Numbers: The range of pages on which the article or chapter appears.
•  DOI (Digital Object Identifier): A unique and persistent identifier for electronic documents, especially journal articles. Strongly preferred over URLs when available.
•  URL (Uniform Resource Locator): The web address of the source. Use when a DOI is not available. Include access date if required by the style guide.
•  Access Date: The date you accessed an online resource. Important for websites as content can change.
•  Edition: If the work is a later edition (e.g., 2nd ed., Revised ed.).
•  Editor(s) / Translator(s): If the work is edited or translated by someone other than the author.

## Common Citation Styles

...Different academic disciplines often prefer specific citation styles. Here are some of the most common:

•  MLA (Modern Language Association): Used primarily in humanities, especially literature and languages.
  •  Emphasizes the author and page number in in-text citations (e.g., (Smith 25)).
  •  Uses "Works Cited" page at the end.
  •  Relatively simple and common.

•  APA (American Psychological Association): Used primarily in psychology, education, and social sciences.
  •  Emphasizes author and year in in-text citation


*   Uses "References" page at the end.
    *   Specific rules for abbreviations, heading styles, and reporting statistics.

•   Chicago/Turabian:  Used in history, art history, and some social sciences.  Two main versions:
    *   Notes and Bibliography: Uses footnotes or endnotes for citations, with a bibliography at the end.  Common in humanities.
    *   Author-Date: Uses parenthetical citations in the text (similar to APA) with a "References" list at the end.  Common in social sciences.

•   IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers): Used in engineering and computer science.
    *   Uses numbered citations in square brackets (e.g., [1]).
    *   Numbered bibliography at the end.

•   AMA (American Medical Association): Used in medicine and health sciences.
    *   Similar to IEEE, using numbered citations in the text.

•   ACS (American Chemical Society): Used in chemistry and related fields.
    *   Can use numbered citations, author-date, or author-title.  Style varies by publication....
    
## Creating a Bibliography

1.  Identify Your Sources:  Keep a careful record of all the sources you consult during your research process.  This is *much* easier to do as you go along than trying to reconstruct it later.  Good practices include:
    *   Creating a digital or physical "research notebook."
    *   Using a citation management tool.
    *   Taking detailed notes, including source information, when you read or view a source.

2.  Collect the Necessary Information:  For each source, gather all the information needed for a bibliographic entry according to the chosen style guide.  Be precise!  Double-check for errors.  Common places to find this information:
    *   Books: Title page, copyright page, table of contents.
    *   Journal Articles: First page of the article, journal website.
    *   Websites:  Header/footer of the page, "About Us" section.

3.  Choose a Citation Style:  Determine which citation style is required by your instructor, publication, or field.

4.  Format the Entries:  Carefully format each entry according to the rules of the chosen citation style. Pay attention to:
    *   Author name order (e.g., Last Name, First Name or First Name Last Name)
    *   Capitalization (e.g., title case, sentence case)
    *   Italics and quotation marks
    *   Punctuation (commas, periods, colons, etc.)
    *   Indentation (hanging indent is common)
    *   Spacing

5.  Organize the Bibliography: Alphabetize the entries by the author's last name (or by title if there is no author).

6.  Proofread Carefully:  Errors in citations can detract from your credibility.  Double-check all entries for accuracy and consistency.

## Tools for Managing Bibliographies

•   Citation Management Software:  These tools help you collect, organize, and format your citations.  They can automatically generate bibliographies in various styles.  Popular options include:
    *   Zotero: Free, open-source, and highly recommended. Integrates well with web browsers and word processors.
    *   Mendeley:  Owned by Elsevier (publisher). Has social networking features.
    *   EndNote:  Commercial software, more feature-rich, often used in scientific fields.
    *   Citationsy: Web based option.
    *   BibMe: Often has advertising/paid features.
•   Word Processor Features:  Microsoft Word and Google Docs have built-in citation management features, but they are generally less powerful than dedicated citation management software.
•   Online Citation Generators: Websites that allow you to input source information and generate a citation in a specific style.  Use with caution, as the output may not always be accurate and you should always double check.  Examples include Citation Machine and EasyBib.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

...•   Incomplete Information:  Missing elements like publisher, date, or page numbers.
•   Inaccurate Information:  Typos, incorrect


author names, or wrong dates.
•   Inconsistent Formatting:  Not following the rules of the chosen citation style consistently.
•   Plagiarism:  Failing to give proper credit to the original sources of your information.
•   Using the Wrong Citation Style:  Choosing a style that is not appropriate for your discipline or publication.
•   Not Proofreading:  Failing to carefully review your bibliography for errors.
•   Not using a citation manager: Doing citations manually increases the chance of making errors.
•   Forgetting access dates: Including the date that online sources were accessed is important since they can change or disappear....

## Advanced Considerations

•   Annotated Bibliographies:  Bibliographies that include a brief summary and evaluation of each source.  These are often assigned in research courses.
•   Legal and Ethical Considerations: Understanding copyright laws and ethical principles related to academic writing.
•   Citation Style Guides:  Refer to the official manuals for each citation style (e.g., *MLA Handbook*, *Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association*, *The Chicago Manual of Style*) for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
