From battling a snowstorm and shoveling mountains of snow to taking the plunge and buying a gym membership, and finally starting the new semester.

## My last week

Well, this past week was definitely a whirlwind! It felt like Mother Nature threw everything she had at us, I finally decided to get my health back on track, and oh yeah, a whole new semester started. Talk about a packed schedule!

First, the snow. We got absolutely hammered! I'm talking drifts up to my knees, roads completely impassable, and the kind of stillness that only a heavy snowfall can bring. Honestly, it was beautiful for about five minutes. Then the shoveling started. I swear I spent more time outside with a shovel in my hand than inside. It was a workout in itself! By the end of it, I was exhausted, but the neighborhood looked pretty good, and I definitely earned my hot chocolate. I did manage to build a pretty awesome snow fort in my yard too. (Still standing!)

Speaking of workouts... after struggling to move my car out the snow (for 3 hours), I finally decided enough was enough! I needed to get serious about getting back in shape. So, I took the plunge and bought a gym membership! I had been putting it off for ages, telling myself I was too busy, or too tired, or whatever. But this week, I just realized it was time. So far, so good! I've been going every day after my lectures, and while I'm definitely feeling the burn (especially after the snow shoveling!), it feels great to be doing something positive for my body. The treadmill and I are becoming good friends... even if I hate it at the same time.

And then, like a cherry on top of a very busy sundae, the new semester started! Already feeling the pressure of deadlines and exams looming on the horizon. It's always a bit overwhelming at the beginning, trying to get organized, figure out the course schedules, and remember everyone's names. Iâ€™ve really decided to commit myself to staying on top of my work this semester though.

It was a busy, tiring, but ultimately fulfilling week. I tackled the snow, faced my fitness demons, and jumped headfirst into a new academic adventure. Bring on the challenges!
