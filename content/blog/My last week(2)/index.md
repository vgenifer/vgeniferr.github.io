title: "My Crazy, Amazing, Rollercoaster Week"
summary: This past week was a mixed bag of experiences. It started with a joyful birthday celebration, followed by the stress of a challenging calculus test that left me feeling unsure. However, the week ended on a high note with the adoption of a new puppy named Snowy, bringing much-needed joy and companionship into my life and outweighing the calculus stress.

## My last week

Okay, seriously, this last week was a whirlwind. It started with my birthday! I turned 19 and had a blast. My friends took me out for suahi and cocktails, and my family surprised me with a delicious cake and baloons. It was exactly what I needed to kick off a new year.

Then came the looming shadow of the calculus test. I spent pretty much every spare moment cramming, reviewing integrals, and trying to wrap my head around derivatives. Honestly, I felt pretty good going in, but as soon as I saw the questions, my stomach dropped. It was HARD. Like, really hard. I stumbled through it, hoping for the best, but I'm still having nightmares about the Chain Rule. I'm trying not to dwell on it, but ugh, that test was a beast.

But the universe must have known I needed a pick-me-up because the best thing happened: we got a dog! We adopted him from the local shelter, and he is the sweetest, fluffiest little thing. We named him Snowy because he's all white and adorable. He's still getting used to his new home, but he's already a master of cuddles and tail wags. Taking care of him has been a huge adjustment, but it's also been incredibly rewarding. Walks, playtime, and puppy training are my new favorite activities. He definitely made up for that awful calculus test. This week was filled with highs and lows, but Snowy definitely tipped the scale towards happiness!
