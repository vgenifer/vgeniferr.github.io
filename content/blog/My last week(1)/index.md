## My last week

This past week was a wonderful mix of new beginnings, cherished moments, and some serious self-care. I'm feeling so refreshed and grateful for the little things!

First off, I finally took the plunge and jumped into the world of yoga and Pilates! I've always been curious about both, and I decided to try a combo class at a local studio. Let me tell you, my muscles are definitely feeling it! It was humbling to realize how inflexible and uncoordinated I am at the start, but it felt amazing to stretch and strengthen my body in new ways. I even managed to (almost) hold a plank for a full minute! More classes are definitely on the horizon. My lower back also really appreciates this decision, hopefully it continues to get better!

Then, purely for the joy of it, I treated myself to a new book. I'd been eyeing this one for a while – a historical fiction novel set in Victorian England. I lost myself in the story this week. There's nothing quite like curling up with a good book and a cup of tea on a chilly evening. I'm only halfway through, but I know it will get nothing less than 5 stars! Highly recommend if you are looking for a new book.

But the highlight of the week was undoubtedly my father's birthday. We had a small family gathering at his favourite restaurant and it was really lovely. Seeing him surrounded by people who love him just made my heart happy. It was great to spend quality time with him and reminisce about old memories and hear his stories. He also made a few too many jokes, but what can you do. Overall, it was a day to remember and I can’t wait for his next birthday!

This past week has been a good reminder of the importance of balance – taking care of my body, nourishing my mind, and cherishing time with loved ones. Definitely a week to remember.
