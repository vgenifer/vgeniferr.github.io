## My last week

This past week was all about getting my act together, both physically and mentally! I finally feel like I'm finding a good rhythm. First off, I've been seriously leveling up my yoga and pilates game. Remember how I could barely touch my toes last month? Well, I'm actually starting to feel more flexible and stronger. I held a plank for a whole minute yesterday (okay, maybe it was 55 seconds, but who's counting?), and I'm almost able to do a proper chaturanga in yoga. It's amazing to see the progress, even if it's slow!

Inspired by my newfound fitness motivation, I decided to take up running. It's definitely a love-hate relationship right now. The first few runs were brutal, but I'm slowly building up my stamina. I can now run for about 20 minutes without stopping, which is a huge win for me. I even managed to convince a friend to join me, so we're holding each other accountable. Early morning runs are definitely not my favorite, but the post-run feeling is unbeatable.

Of course, with all this new exercise, I felt like I deserved some new workout gear. So, I treated myself to some cute leggings and a comfy sports bra. Looking good definitely helps with the motivation, right? Plus, having clothes that actually fit well and wick away sweat makes a huge difference during workouts.

And last but definitely not least, the dreaded words: finals prep. I've started to get organized and make a study schedule. It's overwhelming to think about everything I need to review, but breaking it down into smaller chunks is helping. I'm setting aside specific blocks of time each day to focus on each subject, and I'm trying to stay off social media during those times (wish me luck!). It's going to be a tough few weeks, but I'm determined to finish the semester strong. All in all, it was a week of pushing myself, feeling healthier, and getting ready to tackle the end of the semester.
